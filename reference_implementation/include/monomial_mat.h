 /* consider a n=3 example                   
  *     [ 2  0  0 ]   [             ]
  * M = [ 0  0  1 ] = [ m_0 m_1 m_2 ]
  *     [ 0  3  0 ]   [             ]
  * 
  * Computing GM shuffles the columns of G and rescales them. Assume G is:
  *     [             ]            [                   ]
  * G = [ g_0 g_1 g_2 ]  then GM = [ 2*g_0 3*g_2 1*g_1 ]
  *     [             ]            [                   ]
  * 
  * M is stored in compact form as two arrays, the first one stores the scaling
  * coefficients of the columns (i.e., [2 3 1] in the example), while the second
  * stores, for in each element, the position of the column placed at its index
  * after the permutation. 
  * In the example we have g_0 -> 0, g_1 -> 2, g_2 -> 1 hence we obtain [0 2 1]
